title: "What are AWS S3 roled-based Outputs and how do I use them?"
---

`S3 role-based Outputs` are an alternative way to access your AWS S3 bucket to be used as an Input (Encoding) and/or Output (Encoding/Analytics). Instead of requiring an Access/Secret key pair, we provide you with an AWS IAM user name, to which you then grant specific access rights in your account so it can access your desired S3 bucket.

Have a look at our tutorials for

title: "Can I use Per-Title encoding together with SSAI?"
---

Yes, that is possible!

SSAI providers are usually encoding the ads to a pre-defined set of resolutions and bitrates which is quite static. Changes in resolution are problematic, changes in bitrate not so much. That is why you can just configure the Per-Title encoding to restrict the possible resolutions to a set that is provided by the SSAI provider. The configuration works in the same way as [configuring required resolutions for your Per-Title encoding](/encoding/reference/how-can-i-specify-resolutions-for-a-per-title-encoding-that-are-required-to-be-created).

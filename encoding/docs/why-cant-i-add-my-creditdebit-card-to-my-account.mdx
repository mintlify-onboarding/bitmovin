title: "Why can't I add my credit/debit card to my account?"
---

**Typical issues are:**

* **Invalid CC Details** \- Please make sure to enter the correct card number, expiration date and CVV code.
* **Expired credit card** \- Please get a valid card from your provider, or use a different one.
* **Billing Address Details** \- Make sure the Billing Address details and postal code details are correct.
* **Unsupported Credit Card Provider** \- e.g. virtual credit cards can have restrictions applied to them that prevents from being used with our services. (supported Credit Card Providers: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB, Diners Club, China UnionPay, debit cards)  
   * **Debit Card + PIN requirement** \- If their card requires a PIN to do payments it wonâ€™t work with our online service. Please use a different card then.
* **Geo Restrictions** \- Our payment gateway is located in the US. If the card prohibits to be used there it could be a reason for it to be declined.
* **Active Decline by their Bank/Provider** \- If none of the above applies it can still be that their bank/provider declines the usage of their card for our services. E.g. because their protection system recognized us as a threat, or a small test charge when adding a credit card failed, so did the validation. They would have to get in touch with their provider and have them allowlist us or try a different credit card.

* If the input file contained metadata tags with 4 byte chars then the [Stream Input](/encoding/reference/getencodingencodingsstreamsinputbyencodingidandstreamid) endpoint never returned data. This was fixed and the 4 byte chars are replaced with ï¿½.

---

### 1.43.0

**Added**

* Customers using their own AWS account can now opt-in, so that all HTTP communication on port 9090 and 9999 comes from one specific IP address. This enables a more rigid network security policy where, per default, every IP addressed but one is blocked for HTTP connections.

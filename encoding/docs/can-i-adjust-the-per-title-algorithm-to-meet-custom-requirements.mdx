title: "Can I adjust the Per Title algorithm to meet custom requirements?"
---

Yes, you can. Our template based approach enables great flexibility and helps you cover your use-case best, e.g.: satisfy DRM requirements, target dedicated playout platforms, and many more. Besides the required minimal and maximal resolution (you donâ€™t really need/want a 4k resolution if you target an audience mainly using mobiles) other boundaries in context of bitrate and frame-rate, as well as encoding parameters can be specified as well.

A use-case where only a **[user-defined set of resolutions](/encoding/docs/how-can-i-specify-resolutions-for-a-per-title-encoding-that-are-required-to-be-created)** can be configured as well as a use-case where you want to **[apply DRM to your Per-Title encoding](/encoding/docs/can-i-use-per-title-encodings-with-drm-solutions-like-widevine-playready-or-fairplay)** or use it together with **[SSAI workflow](/encoding/docs/can-i-use-per-title-encoding-together-with-ssai)**.

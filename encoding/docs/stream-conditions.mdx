title: "Stream Conditions"
---

## Introduction

Stream conditions allow you to add conditional logic in your encoding configuration. They ensure that your workflow can automatically adapt to different types of input files and streams.

This page lists the attributes and values available when attaching stream conditions to [Stream resources](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstreamsbyencodingid) through its `conditions` parameter.

Use the [tutorial](/encoding/docs/how-to-adapt-automatically-to-different-source-files-with-stream-conditions) for more information on how to use stream conditions.

## Condition object

A `Condition` has four parameters:

**`type`** 

`"CONDITION"
"AND"
"OR"
`

Set it to "CONDITION" to describe a single condition you want to provide. If you need more than one condition, please see the "Conjuction Object" section.

**`attribute`**

Indicates what aspect of the input is being checked

**`operator`**

Indicates the logical operation to perform between source value and expected value. Possible operators are

`- "=="
- "!="
- "<="
- "<"
- ">"
- ">="
`

Note that if you use our SDKs, the operators are exposed through a ConditionOperator enumeration:

`- "EQUAL" for "=="
- "NOT_EQUAL" for "!="
- "LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL" for "<="
- "LESS_THAN" for "<"
- "GREATER_THAN" for ">"
- "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" for ">="
`

**`value`**

Allows you to state what value to compare against the value extracted from the input file or stream.

All values (including numbers and booleans) should be provided as strings and will be cast automatically into the appropriate type when the encoder performs the condition check. 

### Example

This condition checks if the total count of audio streams within an input file is greater than or equal to 2.

JSON

`{
  type: "CONDITION",
  attribute: "AUDIOSTREAMCOUNT",
  operator: ">=",
  value: "2"
}
`

## Conjunction Object

A `Conjunction` consists of two parameters:

**`type`**

`"AND"
"OR"
`

**`conditions`**

Expect an array of condition objects that will be logically chained together based on conjunction object type.

### Example

JSON

`{
  type: "AND",
  conditions: [
  	{
      type: "CONDITION",
      attribute: "AUDIOSTREAMCOUNT",
      operator: ">=",
      value: "2"
    },
    {
      type: "CONDITION",
      attribute: "DURATION",
      operator: ">=",
      value: "30.56"
    }
  ]
}
`

## Extracted values

At times, you may find that the condition you configure does not seem to work. It may be that the file you are using does not conform to your expectations.

To troubleshoot this, you can verify the result of the analysis stage, by looking at the `analysisDetails` property of the `Stream` (or `inputStreams.analysisDetails` depending on your input configuration), which will be populated during the encoding.

We state below, for each attribute, which property in the `analysisDetails` object will reflect the value extracted from the source during analysis.

_Note that the `analysisDetails` property is only available when you call the REST API directly, and is not currently exposed through the SDKs. You can for example use the REST client embedded in our API reference._

## Input file

The following attributes are used to check the input file:

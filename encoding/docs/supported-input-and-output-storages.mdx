## S3 Compatible Storages

If your storage solution is reachable from our encoder (on the public internet or within your Cloud Connect account), and provides an S3-like API, you may find that it is also supported with our [S3 Generic Input](/encoding/reference/postencodinginputsgenerics3) and [Output](/encoding/reference/postencodingoutputsgenerics3) features. Testing is likely to be required to validate each individual storage product.

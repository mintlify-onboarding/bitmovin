---

### 2.96.0

Released 2021-10-12

**Added**

* Encodings for audio and single-file subtitles without videostreams are supported now. The subtitle outputs are not automatically trimmed to the audio duration in this case.

**Fixed**

---

### 2.95.0

Released 2021-10-04

**Added**

With this release we've improved the encoding capabilities with regards to HDR conversions for H265 output. From now on we support

* Dolby Vision to HDR10
* Dolby Vision to SDR
* HDR10 to HLG
* HLG to HDR10
* SDR to HDR10
* SDR to HLG

The encoder detects the applicable conversion based on the input and the configured output color settings. To make it easier to correctly configure the output we have added preset configurations for the different dynamic range formats. These can be configured on the [H265](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsvideoh265) resource via the setting `dynamicRangeFormat`.

Dolby Vision input can be configured with a [Dolby Vision input stream](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsinputstreamsdolbyvisionbyencodingid)

**Fixed**

* Fixed a bug for H264 and H265 where the specified chroma location was not signaled correctly in the output bitstream.
* Fixed a bug with CustomTags inside HLS audio manifests to be inserted at given KeyFrame positions when there is audio and video encoding. The tags were inserted occasionally a few segments before.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.94.0

Released 2021-09-28

**Added**

* Support for setting `duration=null` for [Time-based Trimming](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsinputstreamstrimmingtimebasedbyencodingid) to indicate that the whole stream should be used (considering offset). `offset=null` will be defaulted to zero now. We also fixed and issue when setting`duration=0` which lead to different results for video and audio. Setting `duration=0` will now lead to 0 frames for video and audio.

**Fixed**

* Inputs with J2K or ProRes codec could have lead to oversaturated output when configured with bt709 and 1080p output.
* Fixed an issue that affected some MOV inputs with an edts (EditListBox) atom. The duration of the edit list entry was not considered and therefore also the media data, that should have been discarded, was present in the output.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.93.0

Released 2021-09-21

**Fixed**

* The [MP3 muxing information endpoint](/encoding/reference/getencodingencodingsmuxingsmp3muxinginformationbyencodingidandmuxingid) now returns the same information like the [MP4 muxing information endpoint](/encoding/reference/getencodingencodingsmuxingsmp4muxinginformationbyencodingidandmuxingid).
* The muxing details endpoints, like [MP4 muxing details](/encoding/reference/getencodingencodingsmuxingsmp4byencodingidandmuxingid), now defaults `minBitrate` to `0` instead of `9223372036854775807`.
* Improved longevity of live-encodings with encryption enabled for audio using fmp4 output and aac codec has been improved.
* Improved the [Auto-Shutdown of Live Encodings](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingslivestartbyencodingid) to detect lost input faster when using a higher `autoShutdownConfiguration.bytesReadTimeoutSeconds` and trigger a shutdown faster.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.92.0

Released 2021-09-14

**Added**

* Automatic shutdown of a live encoding if input is lost and does not reconnect within a certain time period, configurable via the `autoShutdownConfiguration.bytesReadTimeoutSeconds` configuration when starting a [Live Encoding](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingslivestartbyencodingid).
* Automatic shutdown of a live encoding after a certain period of time, configurable via the `autoShutdownConfiguration.streamTimeoutMinutes` configuration when starting a [Live Encoding](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingslivestartbyencodingid).

**Fixed**

* Fixed a bug that led to stalling of Dolby Vision encodings with 50 fps inputs.
* Fixed failed encodings when a Dolby Vision stream was muxed togheter with another audio stream in a progressive muxing.
* Fixed the default\_sample\_duration of the init mp4 file for audio codecs with CMAF muxing. This fixes playback issues with DASH and HLS streams.
* ManifestGenerator `V2`: The Period@start attribute is now set to `0` for the first period. This fixes playback issues for LIVE encodings with DASH manifests in dash.js players.
* `baseMediaDecodeTime` in the init mp4 file for HE-AAC-V1 and HE-AAC-V2 with fMP4 muxing is now set correctly. This fixes playback issues with DASH and HLS streams.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.91.0

Released 2021-09-07

**Added**

* Added new property for DASH manifests which defines the compatibility of the manifest with the Standard DASH Edition. Setting the dash edition compatibility to V4 will support the endNumber attribute for SegmentTemplate DASH manifest, specifying the last available segment. This feature is supported when creating a new DASH manifest via the [startEncoding call](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstartbyencodingid) and configuring the V2 ManifestGenerator OR when creating the manifest via the [DASH manifest creation endpoint](/encoding/reference/postencodingmanifestsdash)

**Fixed**

* Fixed incorrectly reported number of muxed bytes for Dolby Vision encodes with a mix of fragmented and progressive outputs.
* Corrupted subtitle packets are now skipped instead of halting Live encodings

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.90.0

Released 2021-08-31

**Added**

* DRM is now supported for [MP4 muxings](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsmuxingsmp4byencodingid) with [Dolby Digital](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudiodd) and [Dolby Digital Plus](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudioddplus) audio codecs.
* Support input files larger than 2TB on AWS.

**Fixed**

* The color configuration conversion has been enhanced to also support a change of the transfer characteristics even if the color space and color primaries of input and output are identical (e.g. HDR10 to HLG).
* In DASH manifests generated with ManifestGenerator `V2` the AdaptationSet@id attributes were set to UUIDs which caused some players to fail because this property should be an unsigned int.
* Fixed a bug for the manifestGenerator `V2` in combination with [DtsPassThroughAudioCodecConfigurations](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudiodtspassthrough) which caused encodings with VOD DASH manifests to fail and VOD HLS manifests to have an incorrect targetDuration.
* When using [ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#permissions) to provide access to an S3 bucket from another account, the [GetBucketLocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API%5FGetBucketLocation.html) query could have failed, even though the permissions were set correctly which caused the encoding to fail

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.89.1

Released 2021-07-15

**Fixed**

* Fixed the default\_sample\_duration of the init mp4 file for audio codecs with CMAF muxing. This fixes playback issues with DASH and HLS streams.
* Fixed failing audio-only encodings when using [concatenation](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsinputstreamsconcatenationbyencodingid) with input files that include a video stream.
* Fixed a bug with [H264 picture timing trimming](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsinputstreamstrimmingh264picturetimingbyencodingid). If the start timing is before the first keyframe of the input, the start timing is now set to the timing of the first keyframe.
* Fixed a bug which could lead to failed encodings when converting colorspace to BT709.
* Fixed encodings failing when applying both trimming and conform filter with [Dolby Digital](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudiodd) and [Dolby Digital Plus](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudioddplus) audio codecs.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

* This version is automatically mapped to 2.89.1

---

### 2.88.0

Released 2021-08-10

**Added**

* Implemented support for the DTS:HD and DTS:X audio codecs. The openAPI can be found [here](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudiodtsx). Only MP4 and internally fragmented muxings are supported for DTS:HD/DTS:X. DRM configurations are not supported with DTS:HD/DTS:X codecs.
* DRM is now supported for fMP4 muxings with Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.87.0

Released 2021-08-03

**Added**

* Added a new AudioVideoSyncMode `RESYNC_AT_START_AND_END` to the [StartEncodingRequest](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstartbyencodingid). This mode pads audio streams with silence, if the audio streams are shorter than the video stream. This prevents DASH clients trying to download non-existent audio segments, if the mediaPresentationDuration is longer than the duration of the audio stream. This new mode is now also the default value.

**Fixed**

* When running a live encoding with HLS manifests having a `liveEdgeOffset` close to the `segmentLength`, the manifest could have stopped updating after a couple of minutes, although segments are still written correctly

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.86.0

Released 2021-07-27

**Added**

* Manifest generator `V2` is now generally available and supports all manifest features of our API.  
   * It can be used by directly setting manifest IDs in the [start encoding request](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstartbyencodingid) and setting `manifestGenerator` to `V2`.  
   * We are therefore deprecating the manifest generator `V2_BETA` option and will remove it from our API SDKs in release `v2.89.0`.  
   * For more information see our tutorial [here](/encoding/docs/how-to-create-manifests-for-your-encodings).

**Fixed**

* The RFC6381 codec label (e.g. "avc1.64001F") for [CMAF muxings](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsmuxingscmafbyencodingid) is now correctly set in DASH and HLS manifests.
* If the same input source is created twice and used twice in an encoding, we are no longer downloading the input file twice.
* Fixed a bug with handling HEVC inputs with open GOPs which caused encodings to fail.
* RASL (Random Access Skip Leading) frames are now correctly removed from the very first GOP of the HEVC inputs.
* Fixed SegmentTemplate timescale in DASH manifests potentially being set to a wrong value when using variable framerate inputs, causing clients to request a non-existent video segment at the end.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.85.0

Released 2021-07-20

**Added**

   * [BIF](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstreamsbifsbyencodingidandstreamid)  
   * [Sprite](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstreamsspritesbyencodingidandstreamid)  
   * [Thumbnail](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstreamsthumbnailsbyencodingidandstreamid)

**Fixed**

* Muxing an H265 video and Dolby Atmos audio stream into a single MP4 container is now supported.
* We are now more resilient against Azure connection issues when checking if input files exist.
* An issue was fixed where VP9 3-PASS encodings could fail if the target bitrate of a single segment was too close to the codec-level's maximum bitrate.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.84.0

Released 2021-07-13

**Added**

* [IMSC as subtitle output format](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationssubtitlesimsc) from TTML and SRT inputs. For TTML, styling passthrough is available.

**Fixed**

* Color conversion to the following color primaries: bt709, smpte170m, smpte240m, bt2020\. As a result, color primaries conversion from smpte432 to bt2020 is not red-shifted anymore.
* Long running HEVC encodes with 3-pass and `cutree` setting enabled failing in rare cases.
* For [DASH manifests](/encoding/reference/postencodingmanifestsdash), containing Dolby audio renditions, the `codecs` attribute is not set on `AdaptationSet` level anymore but only on the `Representation` level. This also fixes a rare case of duplicate entries in the `codecs` attribute which could have led to device compatibility issues.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.83.1

Released 2021-07-15

**Added**

* [Dolby Digital](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudiodd) and [Dolby Digital Plus](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudioddplus) codec configurations are now available as replacement for AC3 and EAC3.  
   * We are therefore deprecating [AC3](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudioac3) and [EAC3](/encoding/reference/postencodingconfigurationsaudioeac3) as the two new codec configurations are producing output, which conforms to Dolby's high certification standards.  
   * Our [multi-codec example](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-api-sdk-examples#multi-codec-encoding) now uses Dolby Digital instead of AC3.  
   * For more information see our tutorial [here](/encoding/docs/how-to-create-dolby-digital-plus-encodings).
* [Sprite](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstreamsspritesbyencodingidandstreamid) generation no longer requires both width and height to be set, as long as one of the two values is configured, the other one is automatically computed based on the aspect ratio of the video.
* [Thumbnail creation](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsstreamsthumbnailsbyencodingidandstreamid) has been extended to allow the same options with regards to height and width as sprite generation.

**Fixed**

* Improved internal stall-detection to prevent additional edge cases. These edge cases previously lead to stalls resulting in unexpectedly long running encodings.
* Dolby Atmos encodings previously failed if there was an additional unused audio stream along the video stream. This has been fixed.
* Encodings with [input concatenation](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsinputstreamsconcatenationbyencodingid) with inputs that have different fps have occasionally stalled. This was fixed.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.
* `AdaptationSets` in [DASH manifests](/encoding/reference/postencodingmanifestsdash) could contain the same codec multiple times in the `codecs` attribute, when the manifest contains a Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus or a Dolby Atmos rendition.

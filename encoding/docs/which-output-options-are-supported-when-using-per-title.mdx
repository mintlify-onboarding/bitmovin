Per-Title encodings work with GCS, S3, Generic S3, Akamai NetStorage or Azure Blob output.

You can see an example for setting up a per-title encoding with a supported storage option in this [tutorial about how to create a per-title encoding](/encoding/docs/how-to-create-a-per-title-encoding).

You can check [our release notes](/encoding/docs/encoder) to see the latest updates.

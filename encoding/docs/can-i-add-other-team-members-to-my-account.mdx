title: "Can I add other team members to my account?"

Yes, this can be done by utilizing the Multi-Tenant Feature. This feature enables you to grant another Bitmovin account access to your own Bitmovin account. If they don't have an Bitmovin account yet, they have to sign up first.

You can add their new Bitmovin account to a so called “group” in your ["Team" configuration overview](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/account/team). Please see our [tutorial](/encoding/docs/multi-tenant-invite-other-users-to-your-bitmovin-account) about how to use and manage the Multi-Tenant feature in your Bitmovin dashboard for further details.

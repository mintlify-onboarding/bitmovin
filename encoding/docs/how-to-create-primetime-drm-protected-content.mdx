## Overview

**Adobe PrimeTime** is the successor of Adobe Access and was officially launched on the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) show in 2013\. PrimeTime is a DECE approved **Hollywood grade DRM** that is also approved by the **UltraViolet standard**. Adobeâ€™s DRM offers a fine grained policy management system that allows to allowlist applications, devices, domains etc. and it also has support for key and license rotation. The Mozilla Firefox browser supports PrimeTime as Content Decryption Module (CDM) and therefore PrimeTime is natively supported through HTML5 in the Firefox browser.

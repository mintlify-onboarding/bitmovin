### 2.174.0

Released 2023-07-25  
**Fixed**

* Queueing time considerably reduced when using Pre-warmed Encoder Pools.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.172.0

Released 2023-07-11

**Added**

* Internal stability improvements.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

---

### 2.171.0

**Fixed**

* For Live Encodings, when using `AesEncryptionDrm` with a specified `keyFileUri`, the keyFile was not properly uploaded to the designated output. This has been fixed.
* Improved resilience in case of intermittent infrastructure hiccups. If recovery is not possible, the encoding would eventually fail rather than stalling.
* Improve s3 download speed in case the bucket location is not set for the encoding or can't be queried, which can be caused by a missing `s3:GetBucketLocation` permission.

**Added**

* The behaviour of `isDefault` in hls manifest's mediainfo was changed. Setting a value of `isDefault = false` will now be flagged in manifests as `DEFAULT=NO` when using manifest V2.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.

### 2.165.0

 Released 2023-05-09

---

### 2.164.0

 Released 2023-05-03

**Added**

* _autoLevelSetup_: property for video configurations ([h264](postencodingconfigurationsvideoh264), [h265](postencodingconfigurationsvideoh265), [av1](postencodingconfigurationsvideoav1), [vp9](postencodingconfigurationsvideovp9)) to enable/disable the automatic calculation of level, maximum bitrate, and buffer size based on the lowest level that satisfies maximum property values for picture resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. In the case the target level is set explicitly, the maximum bitrate and buffer size are calculated based on the defined level. The _autoLevelSetup_ is enabled by default and is automatically disabled if the maximum bitrate or buffer size is set.

**Fixed**

* PerTitle Algorithm was sometimes losing a configured FIXED\_RESOLUTION\_AND\_BITRATE when the configuration contained two FIXED\_RESOLUTION\_AND\_BITRATE with the same resolution.
* Fixed rare failures for encodings using three-pass with specific content.

**Known Issues**

* S3 role-based output for segmented muxings: No upload verification available.
* **Long running LIVE/VOD Encodings could potentially fail. We highly recommend using [the STABLE version](/encoding/docs/encoder-21000-21490#21490-stable) or the higher versions (from 2.165.0 onwards) for such encodings.**

### 2.153.0

Released 2023-02-07

**Changed**

* We completely overhauled our muxing engine for [fMP4 output](/encoding/reference/postencodingencodingsmuxingsfmp4byencodingid) with codecs H.264, AAC, HE-AAC, and HE-AACv2\. For more details about the changes, [read this article](/encoding/docs/changes-to-fmp4-outputs-in-encoder-version-21530).

**Fixed**

* Manifest segment durations were calculated inaccurately when a concatenation contained fractional and non-fractional framerate changes. Now the segment duration calculation is based on the number of encoded frames.
* Corrected an issue which lead to Nielsen audio watermarking with multiple output video renditions to not be correctly applied under certain conditions.

**Known Issues**

* **Live Encodings using fMP4 or Webm muxings could potentially fail after running longer than appr. 6 hours. We highly recommend using [the STABLE version](/encoding/docs/encoder-21000-21490#21490-stable) or the higher versions (from 2.154.0 onwards) for such encodings.**

title: "How do I cancel my Bitmovin subscription?"
---

After you sign up, your account is running a trial subscription which lasts for 30 days by default, beginning with your registration date. After that time, it expires automatically. In order to continuously use any of our services a paid subscription is required.

## How do I cancel a subscription?

You can cancel a subscription for each of our services at any time on [the plan details page](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/account/billing/plans). The cancellation will be scheduled immediately, and executed by the end of your current billing period, which is typically at the beginning of each month, or at the renewal date of your yearly subscription. The renewal date is also shown in the details view of your subscription in your [Billings section](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/account/billing/plans). In case you exceed the included volume of your subscription until the end of your billing period, a final invoice will be created to charge for exceeded amount.
